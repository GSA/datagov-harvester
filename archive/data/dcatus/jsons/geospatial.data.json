      "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1of the shapefile release year, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

      "description": "Currently, there are many datasets describing landslides caused by individual earthquakes, and global inventories of earthquake-induced landslides (EQIL). However, until recently, there were no datasets that provide a comprehensive description of the impacts of earthquake-induced landslide events. In this data release, we present an up-to-date, comprehensive global database containing all literature-documented earthquake-induced landslide events for the 244-year period from 1772 through May 2020.The database represents an update of the catalog developed by Nowicki Jessee et al. (2020), which summarized events through 2016. The revised catalog contains 264 historical earthquakes, 153 of which include documented landslide fatality counts. The database includes (where available) information on earthquake size (moment magnitude (Mw), surface-wave magnitude (Ms), and body-wave magnitude (mb)), depth, earthquake fault type, date and time, location, the availability of a ShakeMap, which estimates the spatial distribution of ground shaking from the USGS ShakeMap system (Worden and Wald, 2016), the availability of a geospatial landslide inventory, information about landslide occurrence (number of landslides, area or volume of landsliding, area affected by landsliding, landslide magnitude), earthquake/landslide impact (total fatalities, landslide fatalities, and number of injuries due to the effects of the earthquake), and USGS Ground Failure Tool estimates (estimated area and population exposed to landsliding). The full dataset of all known landslide-triggering events is provided as “EQIL Database 2020.csv,” including information on the data source(s) for each data component. A subset of the dataset, showing only those events for which landslide fatality counts are available, is provided as “EQIL Database LSFatality 2020.csv.”",
