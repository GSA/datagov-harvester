{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Spatial data: A large-scale database of modeled contemporary and future water temperature data for 10,774 Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes","description":"Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures globally. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, we modelled daily water temperature profiles for 10,774 lakes in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin for contemporary (1979-2015) and future (2020-2040 and 2080-2100) time periods with climate models based on the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, the worst-case emission scenario.","keyword":["water","temperate lakes","reservoirs","modeling","climate change","thermal profiles","environment","inlandWaters","007","012","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Michigan","Minnesota","South Dakota","Wisconsin","United States","US","Illinois","IL","Indiana","IN","Iowa","IA","Michigan","MI","Minnesota","MN","South Dakota","SD","Wisconsin","WI","Northeast CSC","Rivers, Streams and Lakes","Fish","Climate and Ecosystem Modeling"],"modified":"2017-04-06T20:04:58+00:00","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Robert G Test","hasEmail":"email@address.com"},"identifier":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7DV1H10","accessLevel":"non-public","bureauCode":[],"programCode":[],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"distribution description","downloadURL":"https://distributiontransfer.com/onlineresource.png","mediaType":"format specification","title":"name test 123"}],"license":"MD ID common constraint licence title","rights":"this is a releasability statement. it's important topSecret superSecret","spatial":"-83.0573307815185,41.7553570685206,-96.8589114267623,48.7289513243629","temporal":"1980-01-01T00:00:00+00:00/1995-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","issued":"2016-09-14T15:56:49+00:00","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P2M or R/P0.5M","language":["eng","test_lang_code","test_lang_code2"],"theme":"United States US Illinois IL Indiana IN Iowa IA Michigan MI Minnesota MN South Dakota SD Wisconsin WI","references":"http://resource.associated.org/10/F7DV1H10,http://as0d1028h3.associated.org/10/F7DV1H10,http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7DV1H10,http://additional.doc/10/F7DV1H10,http://additional.doc/56/data.json","landingPage":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7DV1H10","isPartOf":"http://resource.associated.org/10/F7DV1H10","systemOfRecords":"http://as0d1028h3.associated.org/10/F7DV1H10","primaryITInvestmentUII":"57d97341e4b090824ffb0e6f","describedBy":"http://test.something.org/10/F7DV1H10","describedByType":"https"}
